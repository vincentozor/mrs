                <p>Before diving into the game, it's essential to understand what makes GTA San Andreas a standout title. The game takes place in the fictional state of San Andreas, which consists of three major cities: Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas.

                <h2>Exploring the Open-World Experience</h2>
                
                <p>One of the most appealing aspects of GTA San Andreas is its vast open-world design. Unlike previous GTA titles, this game introduces a massive map with diverse landscapes, including urban areas, countryside, forests, deserts, and even a military base. Players can freely explore the world, take on missions, or simply engage in side activities.</p>
                
                <h3>Dynamic Environments and Weather</h3>
